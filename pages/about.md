# About

As a Junior AI Student, I strive to take small steps towards a giant leap in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I firmly believe that Algorithms and Coding are not just subjects to study but crucial problem-solving solving skills. I aim to apply these skills in my real life. Additionally, as an active member of AIESEC and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), I am dedicated to enhancing my soft skills, managerial abilities, and leadership qualities to become a proficient AI scientist.
